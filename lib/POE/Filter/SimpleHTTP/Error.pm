=head1 NAME

POE::Filter::SimpleHTTP::Error - An error object for SimpleHTTP

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use 5.010;
use POE::Filter::SimpleHTTP;
use POE::Filter::SimpleHTTP::Error; #exports constants by default

my $filter = POE::Filter::SimpleHTTP->new();
$filter->get_one_start([qw/junk data goes here/]);
my $ret = $filter->get_one()->[0];

if($ret->isa('POE::Filter::SimpleHTTP::Error'))
{
    say $ret->error(); # 0 (aka. UNPARSABLE_PREAMBLE);
    say $ret->context(); # junkdatagoeshere
}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides the error class and exported constants for use downstream
from the filter to determine what went wrong.

=head1 PUBLIC ACCESSORS

=over 4

=item error()

error() contains the actual error code from the filter that corresponds with
the exported constants. Suitable for use in numeric comparisons (ie. ==)

=item context()

If the error has any context associated with it, it will be stored here. Note 
that some decompression routines do not provide a status message, just return 
undef, and so there is no context returned.

=item INFLATE_FAILED_INFLATE

inflate() failed. Context provided.

=item UNCOMPRESS_FAILED
